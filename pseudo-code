Algorithm: Calculate Synchrony in VR

Inputs:
- user1_data_stream, user2_data_stream: Streams of VR tracking data for two users
- sample_size: Number of data points in each sample (e.g., 20)
- time_interval: Time between data recordings (e.g., 0.2 seconds)
- synchrony_threshold: Threshold for considering users as synchronized (e.g., 60%)

Outputs:
- synchrony_scores: List of synchrony scores for each time segment

Procedure:
1. Initialize synchrony_scores as an empty list

2. While data streams are active:
    2.1 Collect sample_size data points from user1_data_stream and user2_data_stream, sampled every time_interval seconds

    2.2 Normalize data points in both samples for consistency

    2.3 Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient:
        - Calculate covariance between user1 and user2 data samples
        - Calculate standard deviations for both user1 and user2 samples
        - Pearson correlation = covariance / (std_dev_user1 * std_dev_user2)

    2.4 Calculate Spearman's rank correlation:
        - Rank data points in both user1 and user2 samples
        - Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient on the ranks

    2.5 Perform Frequency Analysis:
        - Apply Fourier Transform to both user1 and user2 samples to convert to frequency domain
        - Identify and compare dominant frequencies in both samples

    2.6 Combine measurements into a composite synchrony score:
        - Assign weights to Pearson, Spearman, and Frequency Analysis scores based on their importance
        - Calculate weighted average of these scores

    2.7 If composite synchrony score > synchrony_threshold, consider users synchronized for this segment

    2.8 Append composite synchrony score to synchrony_scores

3. Return synchrony_scores

End Algorithm
